Chrome os exploits


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Q: What exploits are you going to be releasing?                                                               |
| A: ShimWoot - Shimboot but its windows, this is for anyone who sucks with linux or who wants to play certain  |
| games but cant since its not on windows, I'll also be releasing Rec0Dev1l v1, its still in development        |
| and its existence is still theoretical since I've only gotten it to work once but when I get it to work       |
| and make it more stable than I will be releasing it.                                                          |

For current exploits I'd suggest going to MercuryShop or go to Titanium Network
